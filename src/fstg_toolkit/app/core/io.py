class GraphsDataset:
    """Dataset for managing spatio-temporal graphs and associated (meta)data.

    The dataset is lazily loaded from a specified file path, which contains graph and matrix files.
    The dataset includes a description of areas (nodes) in the graphs, factors for grouping subjects,
    and a table of subjects with their associated graph and matrix files.

    Some methods allow for retrieving graphs and matrices by subject IDs,
    checking for the presence of matrices, and serializing/deserializing the dataset.

    Attributes
    ----------
    loader : DataLoader
        Loader object for reading graph and matrix files.
    areas_desc : pandas.DataFrame
        A dataframe describing the areas (nodes) in the graphs.
    factors : list of set of str
        List of sets, each containing factor names for grouping subjects.
    subjects : pandas.DataFrame
        A dataframe containing subject information, indexed by factors and subject ID.

    Methods
    -------
    serialize() -> Dict[str, Any]
        Serializes the dataset into a dictionary format.
    get_graph(ids: Tuple[str, ...]) -> SpatioTemporalGraph
        Retrieves the graph associated with the given subject IDs.
    has_matrices() -> bool
        Checks if the dataset contains matrices for subjects.
    get_matrix(ids: Tuple[str, ...]) -> np.ndarray
        Retrieves the matrix associated with the given subject IDs.
    deserialize(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> 'GraphsDataset'
        Deserializes a dataset from a dictionary format.
    from_filepath(filepath: Path) -> 'GraphsDataset'
        Creates a GraphsDataset instance from a file path, loading the dataset lazily.
